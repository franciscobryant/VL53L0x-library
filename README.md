# VL53L0x-library

<p>This library is made for the purpose of providing an easier alternative in using ST's VL53L0X time of flight sensor. Most of the functionality of this library is based on the VL53L0X API provided by ST (STSW-IMG005). The library includes a very shortlisted number of functions, it does not implement some of the more advanced functionality available in the API (for example, calibration on different conditions). Hence, for a more advanced applications, especially when storage and memory is not an issue, consider using the ST's VL53L0X API directly </p>
